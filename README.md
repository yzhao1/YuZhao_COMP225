Introduction
------------

The Android TechNews application lets you read technology related news from 3 different news sources.

The three news sources are Engadget, AllthingsD and cnBeta(big time tech related news source in China).

The source code of the RSS part came from the website http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/tutorials/x-androidrss/downloads.html.

I rewrite the RSSReader class so that it can fit in the overall structure of Application. Other several helper classes
remained unchanged.
